        <h1><b>Relevant Experiences</b></h1>
        <hr>
        <h2><b>Software Engineer in Test</b></h2>
        <h3>Applied Medical | January 2021 - Present | Rancho Santa Margarita, CA</h3>
        <p> At <a href="https://www.appliedmedical.com/" >Applied Medical</a> as a software test engineer, I design, build, and maintain test frameworks
          focused on surgical systems. Utilizing Gitlab and Python, I have automated data analysis and also maintained
          additional test automations focused on the Voyant electrosurgical systems. I participate in daily scrum and sprint
          meetings and continually track and investigate defects impacting either the device or additional production tools.</p>
    
        <h2><b>Biomedical Electronics Technician</b></h2>
        <h3>Nihon Kohden America | August 2020 - January 2021 | Irvine, CA</h3>
        <p> At <a href="https://us.nihonkohden.com/" > Nihon Kohden </a> as a Biomedical Electronics Technician, I investigated and repaired a stock of patient monitors
          following defects. I updated project flow and tracked complaints through Jira and SAP to ensure the complaint
          addressed was resolved through repair. I manually tested each monitor to figure out the cause of issue, whether it
          be a physical/aesthetic defect or functional defect correlated with the physiological sensors such as EKG, SPO2, or
          blood pressure</p>
    
        <h2><b>NIH-BUILD Tissue Engineer</b></h2>
        <h3>CSULB BUILD | May 2017 - May 2020 | Long Beach, CA</h3>
        <p> Working in the <a href="http://www.ayalalab.com/" >Ayala Lab </a>, we focused on developing and engineering a
          topographical muscle scaffold that would work to help with muscle regeneration while decreasing rates of scar creation.
          Using a combination of decellurized tissue and collagen, we created a scaffold with linear grooves to match muscle
          topographical patterns. Within this project, I also developed Matlab and Python scripts for image processing and data analysis
          to observe the extensiveness of muscle growth on the patch. I was able to present my research at numerous biomedical conferences
          including BMES, SACNAS, and ABRCMS.
        </p>
    
        <h2><b>SRTP Research Scholar</b></h2>
        <h3>UCSF SRTP | May 2019 - August 2019 | San Francisco, CA</h3>
        <p> I had the opportunity to intern at UCSF within the student research training program. I worked within the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory with the <a href="https://allistonlab.ucsf.edu/">Alliston lab </a> looking at the effects of TGF-β on bone homeostasis at the knee joint.
          I was a co-author for a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41548">published article </a> using the results I obtained through the summer on
          how TGF-β affects mechanosensitive activity of cartilage and subchondral bone.</p>
